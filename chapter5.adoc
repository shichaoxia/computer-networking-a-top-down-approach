=== NAT Measurement Scenario

Open the NAT_home_side file and answer the following questions.

image::ch5-wireshark-nat/home.png[width=500]

. What is the IP address of the client?
+
192.168.1.100

. The client actually communicates with several different Google servers in order to implement “safe browsing.” (See extra credit section at the end of this lab). The main Google server that will serve up the main Google web page has IP address 64.233.169.104. In order to display only those frames containing HTTP messages that are sent to/from this Google, server, enter the expression “http && ip.addr == 64.233.169.104” (without quotes) into the Filter: field in Wireshark .
+

. Consider now the HTTP GET sent from the client to the Google server (whose IP address is IP address 64.233.169.104) at time 7.109267. What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP GET?
+
192.168.1.100 → 64.233.169.104 +
4335 → 80

. At what time is the corresponding 200 OK HTTP message received from the Google server? What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP 200 OK message?
+
7.158797 +
64.233.169.104 → 192.168.1.100 +
80 → 4335

. Recall that before a GET command can be sent to an HTTP server, TCP must first set up a connection using the three-way SYN/ACK handshake.
.. At what time is the client-to-server TCP SYN segment sent that sets up the connection used by the GET sent at time 7.109267?
+
7.075657

.. What are the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports for the TCP SYN segment?
+
192.168.1.100 → 64.233.169.104 +
4335 → 80

.. What are the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports of the ACK sent in response to the SYN.
+
64.233.169.104 → 192.168.1.100 +
80 → 4335

.. At what time is this ACK received at the client?
+
7.108986

Open the NAT_ISP_side.

image::ch5-wireshark-nat/isp.png[width=500]

[start=6]
. In the NAT_ISP_side trace file, find the HTTP GET message was sent from the client to the Google server at time 7.109267 (where t=7.109267 is time at which this was sent as recorded in the NAT_home_side trace file).
.. At what time does this message appear in the NAT_ISP_side trace file?
+
6.069168

.. What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP GET (as recording in the NAT_ISP_side trace file)?
+
71.192.34.104 → 64.233.169.104 +
4335 → 80

.. Which of these fields are the same, and which are different, than in your answer to question 3 above?
+
向外发送的分组，NAT路由器将源IP地址从主机的修改为自己的；其余相同。

. Are any fields in the HTTP GET message changed? Which of the following fields in the IP datagram carrying the HTTP GET are changed: Version, Header Length, Flags, Checksum. If any of these fields have changed, give a reason (in one sentence) stating why this field needed to change.
+
HTTP GET报文没有改变。 +
IP数据报的Checksum字段由0xa94a变为0x022f，改变的原因是因为源IP地址变了。

. In the NAT_ISP_side trace file,

.. at what time is the first 200 OK HTTP message received from the Google server?
+
6.117570

.. What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP 200 OK message?
+
64.233.169.104 → 71.192.34.104 +
80 → 4335

.. Which of these fields are the same, and which are different than your answer to question 4 above?
+
由外向内发送的分组，NAT路由器将分组的目的IP由自己的改为主机的，其余不变。

. In the NAT_ISP_side trace file,
.. at what time were the client-to-server TCP SYN segment and the server-to-client TCP ACK segment corresponding to the segments in question 5 above captured?
+
SYN: 6.035475 +
SYN ACK: 6.067775

.. What are the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports for these two segments?
+
SYN: 71.192.34.104 → 64.233.169.104, 4335 → 80 +
SYN ACK: 64.233.169.104 71.192.34.104, 80 → 4335

.. Which of these fields are the same, and which are different than your answer to question 5 above?
+
SYN报文段的源IP地址不同，NAT路由器将主机的IP修改为自己的IP，IP数据报的首部检验和也要改变。SYN ACK报文段的目的IP地址不同，NAT收到该报文段之后将目的地址改为主机的IP地址。

. Using your answers to 1-8 above, fill in the NAT translation table entries for HTTP connection considered in questions 1-8 above.

==== Extra Credit

In the NAT_home_side trace file, consider the client-to-server GET at time 1.572315, and the GET at time 7.573305. Research the use of these two HTTP messages and write a half page explanation of the purpose of each of these messages.

这些请求和响应是有关link:https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4[Safe Browsing]的。

The Safe Browsing APIs (v4) let your client applications check URLs against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Examples of unsafe web resources are social engineering sites (phishing and deceptive sites) and sites that host malware or unwanted software. Any URL found on a Safe Browsing list is considered unsafe.

这个请求和响应是有关link:https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/network-portal-detection[Network Portal Detection]的。

[quote]
Shill, the connection manager for Chromium OS, attempts to detect services that are within a captive portal whenever a service transitions to the ready state.  This determination of being in a captive portal or being online is done by attempting to retrieve the webpage http://clients3.google.com/generate_204.  This well known URL is known to return an empty page with an HTTP status 204.  If for any reason the web page is not returned, or an HTTP response other than 204 is received, then shill marks the service as being in the portal state.
